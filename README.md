# 8 Puzzle

This is an implementation of a 8 puzzle game being solved through traversal algorithms.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Depth first search
- [ ] Breadth first search
- [ ] Uniform cost search
- [ ] A\* search simple heuristic
- [ ] A\* search better heuristic

## Data structures

- Depth first search
  - Visited nodes: **stack**
- Breadth first search
  - Visited nodes: **queue**
- Uniform cost search
  - Visited nodes: **sorted list**
- A\* search
  - Visited nodes: **sorted list**

## Tasks

- Node
  - [x] Structure
  - [x] Is objective
  - [x] Compare
- Visited list
  - [ ] Structure
  - [ ] Sort
  - [ ] Find
- Runtime
  - [ ] Interval
  - [x] Generate random inital state
- Search
  - [ ] Weights
  - [ ] Prediction heuristic

## Bonus

- [ ] Display node
- [ ] Display solving process
